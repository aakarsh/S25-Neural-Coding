This problem set will likely take between **8 to 15 hours** to complete thoroughly.

Total Points Attempted: 4/11
Total Time Remaining :  7 

Here's a rough breakdown:

---
## Problem 1: Bernoulli Neuron (Total: ~4.5 - 9 hours)

- **(a) Fisher Information Js‚Äã:** (0.5 - 1 hour)
    - Involves taking derivatives of the log-likelihood.
- **(b) Plotting Fisher Information:** (1 - 2 hours)
    - Requires applying the formula from (a), potentially looking up the Poisson Fisher Information, and coding the plots (e.g., in Python with matplotlib).
- **(c) Variance, Bias, MSE:** (1.5 - 3 hours)
    - This part can be calculation-intensive, requiring careful computation of expectations for the given estimator. Checking with WolframAlpha adds a bit of time.
- **(d) Ideal Observer s^MS‚Äã(r):** (1.5 - 3 hours)
    - This is a more involved Bayesian calculation, requiring careful application of the law of total probability, Bayes' theorem, and performing the indicated integrations.
- **(e*) Cramer-Rao Bound Context:** (0.5 - 1 hour)
    - Conceptual explanation and linking previous results.

## Problem 2: Minimum Discrimination Error (MDE) (Total: ~3.5 - 6 hours)

- **(a) Diagrams and MAP Estimator:** (1 - 1.5 hours)
    - Requires careful case differentiation based on Œª and x, visualizing the decision boundaries, and writing down the estimator rules.
- **(b) Analytical MDE Computation:** (1 - 2 hours)
    - Involves setting up and solving integrals for the error probabilities in each case.
- **(c) Simulation Confirmation:** (1.5 - 2.5 hours)
    - This involves coding: generating stimuli and responses, applying the estimator, computing the MDE from simulations, and comparing with analytical results. This also includes debugging and ensuring the simulation covers all cases.

**Factors influencing the total time:**

- **Your familiarity with the concepts:** If you've recently covered Fisher information, Bayesian estimation, MSE, MDE, and the Cramer-Rao bound, it will be faster.
- **Mathematical proficiency:** Speed and accuracy with calculus (derivatives, integrals) and probability manipulations.
- **Coding skills:** For the plotting and simulation parts (Python with libraries like NumPy and Matplotlib is common).
- **Attention to detail:** Careful calculations and checking your work will save time in the long run by avoiding errors.

This estimate assumes focused work. Good luck! üçÄ
